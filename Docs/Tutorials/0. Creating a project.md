Note: If you just want to mess around with the engine it is recommended to use the Sandbox project in the engine solution

Note 2: The build process for applications using the engine is a bit fucked up at the moment.
Everything might change in the future.

### Creating a project that uses CatWare
CatWare utilizes the XMake build system, and for ease of use it is recommended that the game also used XMake.
XMake can also generate projects in other build systems.
You can get xmake [here](https://xmake.io/#/)

## Getting CatWare
To obtain a copy of the CatWare source code use git to clone it.
Do not download as archive from github as that will not include required submodules.

```git clone https://github.com/CatCodeSoftware/CatWareEngine```

Or you can add it as a submodule to your repository

```git submodule add https://github.com/CatCodeSoftware/CatWareEngine CatWareEngine```

## xmake.lua
In your project directory create a file called xmake.lua

In the file include the folder you cloned CatWare into and create your game project

```lua
add_rules("mode.debug", "mode.release")

includes("CatWareEngine")

target("Game")
    -- Set project as executable
    set_kind("binary")

    -- Set the c++ version, CatWare uses c++ 20 but doesn't use most of it's features
    set_languages("cxx20") 

    -- Set the working directory for the project
    set_rundir("$(projectdir)/GameFiles")

    -- Add the engine as a dependency
    add_deps("CatWareEngine")

    -- Platform defines
    if is_plat("windows") then
		add_defines("CW_PLATFORM_WIN64")
	end

    -- Include some pakcages required by the engine
	add_includedirs("CatWareEngine/Engine/Lib/glm")

    -- Include the engine itself
    add_includedirs("CatWareEngine/Engine/Source")

    -- Add packages required by the engine
    -- XMake automatically fetches these from the internet
    add_packages("libsdl", "freetype", "soloud")

    -- Add the game sourec
    add_files("Game/Source/**.cpp")
    add_headerfiles("Game/Source/**.h")
    add_includedirs("Game/Source/")
```

Remember to copy the EngineRes folder from Engine/WorkDir to your game's working directory

To generate a project run the command ```xmake project -k project_type -m "debug;release"```
