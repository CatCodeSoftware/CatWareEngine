In the previous tutorial we wrote an application that created a window and drew a red square in the corner of the screen

```cpp
#include <CatWare.h>

class InGame : public CatWare::Scene
{
public:
	void Draw( ) override
	{
		CatWare::Rendering::Renderer::Clear( { 0, 0, 0, 255 } ); // Clears the screen, uses CatWare::Color class
		CatWare::Rendering::Renderer::DrawRect(
			{ 20, 20 }, // Vector2D, xy position of the rectangle
			{ 100, 100 }, // Vector2D, width and height of the rectangle
			{ 255, 0, 0, 255 } // Color, RGBA color
		 );
	}
};

class Game : public CatWare::Application
{
public:
	InGame* inGame;

	Game( )
	{
		inGame = new InGame( );
	}

	~Game( )
	{
		delete inGame;
	}

	void PostInit( ) override
	{
		SetScene( inGame );
	}
};

CW_REGISTER_APP( Game )
```

But the window was 1280x720 and was titled CatWare. This can be changed in one of two ways.

## Method 1 - Changing after initializing
In CatWare::Application there is a variable called window. It's an object of class CatWare::Window.

It containts 3 methods relevant to this topic.
- SetSize( int width, int height ) - Changes the size of the window.
- SetFullscreen( bool fullscreen ) - Sets if the window is fullscreen or not.
- SetTitle( std::string title ) - Sets the title of the window.

```cpp
void PostInit( ) override
{
	// Sets the window to be a 1920x1080 fullscreen window titled "My Game"  
	window->SetTitle( "My game" );
	window->SetSize( 1920, 1080 );
	window->SetFullscreen( true )

	SetScene( inGame );
}
```

## Method 2 - InitConfig
In CatWare::Application there is a variable called initConfig. This variable stores information to be used by the engine to initialize.
It needs to be edited before PostInit is called, preferably in the constructor of your application. If you are changing window parameters on startup this is the preferred option.

It contains 4 variables relevant to this topic
- windowWidth - Width of the window.
- windowHeight - Height of the window.
- windowTitle - Title of the window.
- windowFullscreen - Is window fullscreen.

```cpp
Game( )
{
	initConfig.windowTitle = "My Game";
	initConfig.width = 1920;
	initConfig.height = 1080;
	initConfig.windowFullscreen = true;

	inGame = new InGame( );
}
```
