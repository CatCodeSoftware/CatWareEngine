### CatWare Engine
CatWare is a game engine developed and used by Cat Code Software to build games.

## Building
##### Note: There is currently an issue with xmake and you can't configure the project. If this is not resolved soon we might consider adding an alternate build system
CatWare uses xmake to generate projects. Install xmake here https://xmake.io
To generate a Visual Studio solution open your terminal and run ```xmake project -k vsxmake2022 -m "debug;release"``` or see [this tutorial](https://github.com/CatCodeSoftware/CatWareEngine/blob/main/Docs/Tutorials/0.%20Creating%20a%20project.md) to see how to include the engine in your project.
