##  The Application class
Start off by including the CarWare.h header. It contains everything you'll need to make a game using CatWare.

```cpp
#include <CatWare.h>
```

The base for everything is the Application class. Create a class with the name of your game which inherits from CatWare::Application.
At the bottom put CW_REGISTER_APP( NameOfTheApplicationClass ). The Application has a PostInit function which is called after the engine is fully initialized.

```cpp
class Game : public CatWare::Application
{
public:
	void PostInit( ) override
	{
		
	}
};

CW_REGISTER_APP( Game )
```

If you run this program you should see a blank window. By default it's 1280x720 and has the title CatWare.

## Scene class
The scene essentially a game state. It can be the main menu, the actual in-game part or a loading screen.
Scenes are created by creating a class that inherits from CatWare::Scene.

The scene has 5 methods that can be overriden.
- SwitchTo - Called when this scene is set as the current scene.
- SwitchOff - Called when this scene is discarded and a new scene is set as the current scene.
- Update - Called every frame. Runs the game logic.
- Tick - Called every time a certain amount of time passes. Runs the game logic.
- Draw - Called every frame. Draws everything on the screen

For now let's make a simple scene that draws a square in the top left corner of the screen.

```cpp
class InGame : public CatWare::Scene
{
public:
	v
};
```

To set our scene as the current scene call SetScene in the PostInit method of the application class. It's the applications responsibility to delete the scene after it's no longer used.

```cpp
class Game : public CatWare::Application
{
public:
	InGame* inGame;

	Game( )
	{
		inGame = new InGame( );
	}

	~Game( )
	{
		delete inGame;
	}

	void PostInit( ) override
	{
		SetScene( inGame );
	}
;

CW_REGISTER_APP( Game )
```


You should now see a red square on the screen.

### Full code
```cpp
#include <CatWare.h>

class InGame : public CatWare::Scene
{
public:
	void Draw( ) override
	{
		CatWare::Rendering::Renderer::Clear( { 0, 0, 0, 255 } ); // Clears the screen, uses CatWare::Color class
		CatWare::Rendering::Renderer::DrawRect(
			{ 20, 20 }, // Vector2D, xy position of the rectangle
			{ 100, 100 }, // Vector2D, width and height of the rectangle
			{ 255, 0, 0, 255 } // Color, RGBA color
		 );
	}
};

class Game : public CatWare::Application
{
public:
	InGame* inGame;

	Game( )
	{
		inGame = new InGame( );
	}

	~Game( )
	{
		delete inGame;
	}

	void PostInit( ) override
	{
		SetScene( inGame );
	}
};

CW_REGISTER_APP( Game )
```
