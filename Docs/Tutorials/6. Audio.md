## Loading a sound
In order to load a sound you need to use the Assets::sound.Add() function.
For now CatWare only supports wave files.

```cpp
Assets::sound.Add( "soundName", "sound/path.wav" )
```

To play a sound use either
- CatWare::AudioEngine::PlaySound()
- CatWare::AudioEngine::PlaySound2D()

PlaySound plays a sound normally and returns a CatWare::AudioHandle pointer.

```cpp
AudioHandle* handle = CatWare::AudioEngine::PlaySound( Assets::sounds.Get( "soundName" ) )
```

PlaySound2D plays a sound in 2D space that automatically adjusts the pan and volume based off distance. It returns an AudioHandle2D pointer.

```cpp
AudioHandle2D* handle = CatWare::AudioEngine::PlaySound2D( 
    Assets::sounds.Get( "soundName" ), // Sound
    1.0, // volume
    400 // radius
)
```
